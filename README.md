#Food Truck Management System

This is the final group project for ECSE 321: Introduction to Software Engineering at McGill University. The project is to create a working food truck management system that can manage staff, menu, and inventory.

The program has to function on three platforms and has to respond to the following user story:

>There are many facets to running a successful food truck. The Food Truck Management System (FTMS) supports managers of food trucks by keeping track of staff schedules, equipment and food supply levels, and menu item and their popularity in one central location. The FTMS offers users the ability to keep track of staff, their roles (i.e., cashier or cook), and their weekly schedules. The FTMS also offers users the ability to track equipment (e.g., grills, deep fryers, knives), supplies (e.g., cheese, lettuce, tomato), and their quantities. Finally, the FTMS offers user the ability to track customer orders in order to compute reports about the most popular menu items.
